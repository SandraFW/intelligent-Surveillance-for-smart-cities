\section{Introduction}
The following is a sample outline for a project proposal. 
Note that all questions for a section may not apply to
your proposal, and should be used as a general guide only.
\subsection{Background}
The video surveillance system is a crucial component in the development of Smart Cities where they are useful for crime prevention, terrorist or forensic evidence detection, and traffic monitoring but the old traditional surveillance cannot accomplish it that's why smart surveillance systems with smart detection modules were introduced and always in enhancements till now.
 
\cite{1}However, implementing a citywide smart video surveillance system involves many challenges. A large number of cameras have to be deployed across the city, producing huge amounts of data and information every day. Also, Besides, storing and enabling access to video devices and data at this large scale, in both real-time and on-demand manner, demand more computing and storage resources than traditional video surveillance systems. These challenges have to be addressed to maximize the effectiveness of smart video surveillance. 

Cloud computing was proposed then to solve some of those issues as mentioned in \cite{2} and \cite{3}, and it proved to be efficient but with the growth of data, it could not accomplish the desired results, and fast response due to the possible delay of transmitting the data to and from the cloud server, and also it could not solve the privacy and security concerns. So The term Fog Computing and video summarising were introduced.
\subsection{Motivation}
\subsubsection{Academic}
This should be 1 to 3 paragraphs that discuss Academic needs for your project (\textbf{Why is this problem interesting}). You must include references.
For this section consider answering the following questions:
\begin{enumerate}
\item What is the history of the problem?
\item Why is this problem interesting?
\item When and why does the problem occur?
\item Is the problem already solved? 
\item What is the most current/successful solutions available now?
\item Reference and very briefly explain the most important related solutions.
What are possible improvements to current solutions?
\end{enumerate}
\subsubsection{Business}
Discuss business Needs for your project.

\subsection{Problem Statement}
Please put a focus on 1-2 challenges that this project aims to solve and state them very clear as your formal problem statement.

\section{Project Description}
List initial project requirements. A good requirement states something that is \textbf{necessary}, \textbf{verifiable}, and \textbf{attainable}. Even if it is verifiable and attainable if it is not necessary, it is not a good requirement \cite{hooks1994writing}.
\\
\\Show down with a figure the proposed system.

\subsection{Objectives}
Write as a minimum three statements that describe the “what” of your project. \\The concrete and measurable “what”. 
\\Aim to use the specific, measurable, assignable, realistic, and time-related (SMART) method for writing effective Objectives.
Examples of good Objectives:
\begin{itemize}
\item We will reduce the number of clicks it takes for a user to reach the highest traffic page that the majority of our website users regularly visit (the member directory) from any point on the site to 2 clicks or less by the end of our design phase on June 1st.
\item We will write the SRS document to meet with IEEE 830-1998 standard, which will be delivered by December 2020.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Scope}
The scope of your project.
\subsection{Project Overview}
Some extra details for your system implementations.
\subsection{Stakeholder}
\subsubsection{Internal}
State who is the team leader. list all team members with their responsibilities
\subsubsection{External}
State who are the End Users and clients

\section{Similar System}
\subsection{Academic}

List down at least 10 papers from ACM and IEEE for similar work experience in the domain of your problem. You can add 5 papers or more from other sources (Springer, Elsevier,  ..etc)

Be sure that each paper you list include the following points

\begin{enumerate}
\item The main problem statement of the work.
\item How the researchers contributed to solve the problem
\item The dataset used by the researchers
\item What main results the researchers reach.
\item Criticize the paper
\item Figure/s of the work (if available)
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Business Applications}
Describe available business applications the the market with figures. (Optional)

\section{What is new in the Proposed Project?}

\section{Proof of concept}
Demonstrate the 10\% implemented in your project so far.

\section{Project Management and Deliverables}
\subsection{Deliverables}
\begin{itemize}
\item What will the project produce? (program, reports, etc.)
\item Describe in brief detail the features of each of the deliverables.
\item Separate deliverables into milestones (based on MIU graduation project calendar)
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Tasks and Time Plan}
Use some software for primitive plan of your project.
\subsection{Budget and Resource Costs}

\section{Supportive Documents}
Add sections covering one or more of the following:
\begin{itemize}

\item Dataset.
\item Contact documents
\item users/survey
\item Contacting authors.

\end{itemize}

\section {References}
20 Reference Minimum (80\% Academic)
\printbibliography
\end{document}
