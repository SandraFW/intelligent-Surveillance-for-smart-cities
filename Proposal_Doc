\begin{abstract}
Surveillance systems are of vital importance for the development of smart cities. These systems can be considered vision organs of such cities. It is expected that a huge amount of data (Big Data) will be generated in smart cities. Therefore, to ensure the safety of its citizens, it is important to provide an efficient and real-time analysis of these data to get real-time responses, when catastrophic events occur. Accordingly, transmitting this massive data to the cloud, to be processed, is relatively slow. Therefore, the purpose of this project is to implement an edge computing- based surveillance system to offer real-time data processing. When surveillance videos capture an incident, the data get transferred to the edge for processing. Moreover, a rapid response is then provided to properly handle the occasion. Furthermore, despite tackling scalability obstacles, the system should handle privacy-sensitive data to overcome the privacy challenges in smart cities.

\section{Introduction}
The following is a sample outline for a project proposal. 
Note that all questions for a section may not apply to
your proposal, and should be used as a general guide only.
\subsection{Background}
The video surveillance system is a crucial component in the development of Smart Cities where they are useful for crime prevention, terrorist or forensic evidence detection, and traffic monitoring but the old traditional surveillance cannot accomplish it that's why smart surveillance systems with smart detection modules were introduced and always in enhancements till now.
 
\cite{1}However, implementing a citywide smart video surveillance system involves many challenges. A large number of cameras have to be deployed across the city, producing huge amounts of data and information every day.Besides, storing and enabling access to video devices and data at this large scale, in both real-time and on-demand manner, demand more computing and storage resources than traditional video surveillance systems. These challenges have to be addressed to maximize the effectiveness of smart video surveillance. 

Cloud computing was proposed then to solve some of those issues as mentioned in \cite{2} and \cite{3}, and it proved to be efficient but with the growth of data, it could not accomplish the desired results, and fast response due to the possible delay of transmitting the data to and from the cloud server, and also it could not solve the privacy and security concerns. So The term Fog Computing and video summarising were introduced .
\subsection{Motivation}
\subsubsection{Academic}
Since smart cities utilize IoT devices in recent times, in order to improve their infrastructure, numerous amounts of data get generated at a rapid rate. Passing data to the cloud is unfavorable when dealing with surveillance systems, as these systems require urgent and  instant responses to avoid misfortune events. Therefore, it is necessary to procure a strategy that will assist in managing and processing data effectively in a short period of time. Edge computing is a recently proposed solution for this problem. Instead of transferring data to the cloud, it gets transferred to the edge for real-time data processing. Various techniques are used to exploit this new technology and use it efficiently to solve different barriers. B. V. Natesha and Ram Mohana Reddy Guddeti \cite{nateshafog} proposed a fog computing based surveillance system, for smart cities, that processes data using deep learning methods in order to provide low latency and minimize the cost of the services. Likewise, G. Baldoni et al. \cite{baldoni2017dynamic} present edge computing to reduce the network traffic and offer scalability.
\subsubsection{Business}
With the expansion of IoT devices in smart cities, there are a massive amount of data generated from the cameras. Edge-based surveillance system provides the business and the organizations with significant benefits. It provides real time data processing analysis which help the organizations to take a proper action and make immediate decision efficiently in case of any accident or abnormal events. Furthermore, The huge organizations as the smart cities need to keep their information and their citizens data secure .Edge computing provides the system with security and privacy while working on a lower bandwidth. Moreover, Edge computing needs limited storage in order to keep the data.so, there is no need for a central server for action taking. Therefore it provides the business and the organizations with lower costs.
\subsection{Problem Statement}
One of the challenges that face a surveillance systems in smart cities is Big data, as the smart city involves huge amount of cameras in 24/7 mode to cover the whole city. Each camera records a massive amount of video and audio data to be processed. To handle such a massive data, it is essential to provide a way to get real-time data processing analysis efficiently. Cloud computing has been utilized to perform data processing analysis leading to slower performance. Therefore, edge computing is essential for real-time data processing analysis with high performance and low latency.
