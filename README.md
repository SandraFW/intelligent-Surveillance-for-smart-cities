# intelligent-Surveillance-for-smart-cities(EFISS)

the purpose of this project is to implement an edge Fog computing- based surveillance system to offer real-time data processing. When surveillance videos capture an incident, the data get transferred from the edge to fog layer for processing. Moreover, a rapid response is then provided to properly handle the occasion. Furthermore, despite tackling scalability obstacles, the system should handle privacy-sensitive data to overcome the privacy challenges in smart cities
