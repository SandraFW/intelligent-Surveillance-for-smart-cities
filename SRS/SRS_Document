\section{Similar Systems}
\subsection{Academic}
\begin{itemize}
\item In the hopes of decreasing and preventing crimes in a smart home environment (SHE), Tanin Sultana and Khan A. Wahid \cite{sultana2019iot} proposed a framework called IoT guard. The authors designed an edge-fog architecture to assist in detecting crimes, predicting them, and sending alerts to police units to take immediate actions and prevent any catastrophic event from occurring. As shown in Figure \ref{security}, Initially, the edge nodes, or the cameras, detect if an event took place. Whenever an action is detected, the edge nodes will forward the surveillance data to the fog nodes to get processed. The fog nodes will then apply object detection algorithms, predict possible events, send alerts to the police unit, and finally send data to the cloud server for system updates or any further analysis. Results show the system’s performance is better than transitional IoT surveillance systems. It is efficient and scalable.

    \label{security}
\end{figure}

\item Hui Sun et al. \cite{sun2019vu} presented an edge computing-enabled video usefulness model (VU) in order to handle failures that might occur in surveillance videos, using failure detection approaches, as it usually takes a great amount of time for maintenance teams to determine what causes the failure. Moreover, the system provides bandwidth improvement, as useless video surveillance data might consume bandwidth that is needed by useful and informative videos. Experimental results show that the system detects failures efficiently.

For example:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The user shall be able to search either all of the initial set of databases or select a subset from it. 
\item The admin shall update security rules.
\item The user shall be able to create a new event.
\end{enumerate}

\end{table}

\section{Operational Scenarios}
This section should describe a set of scenarios that illustrate, from the user's perspective, what will be experienced when utilizing the system under various situations. 
In the article Inquiry-Based Requirements Analysis (IEEE Software, March 1994), scenarios are defined as follows: 
In the broad sense, a scenario is simply a proposed specific use of the system. More specifically, a scenario is a description of one or more end-to-end transactions involving the required system and its environment. Scenarios can be documented in different ways, depending up on the level of detail needed. The simplest form is a use case, which consists merely of a short description with a number attached. More detailed forms are called scripts. These are usually represented as tables or diagrams and involved identifying an action and the agent (doer) of the action. For this reason, a script can also be called an action table. 
Although scenarios are useful in acquiring and validating requirements, they are not themselves requirements, because the describe the system's behavior only in specific situations; a specification, on the other hand, describes what the system should do in general. 

\section{Project Plan}
This section provides an initial version of the project plan, including the major tasks to be accomplished, their inter-dependencies, and their tentative start/stop dates. The plan also includes information on hardware, software, and  resource requirements. 
The project plan should be accompanied by one or more PERT or GANTT charts such as the chart shown in Figure \ref{fig:GANTT Chart}.\\
The plan should include the projects task and who is responsible for this task.
